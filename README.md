Lollagram - Instagram Real Time App
=============

## Intro

A real-time responsive "picture wall" that streams images from Instagram for specific hashtags.

This is a fork of [`instagram-real-time` by weblancaster](https://github.com/weblancaster/instagram-real-time).

## Original intro

From the [original repository](https://github.com/weblancaster/instagram-real-time#intro):

> To learn a little bit more of NodeJS, Socket.IO and for fun I developed the new version of Lollagram
consuming Instagram Real Time API.

> Feel free to ask me anything and I will do my best to answer any question.

> Lollagram is a labor of love thatâ€™s designed to help you keep track of the Lollapalooza experience, through the eyes (or, more accurately, snapshots) of music lovers on the ground at Grant Park. Lollagram takes advantage of the Instagram Real Time API and aggregates the moments at Lollapalooza, creating a visual record of the bands, food, people, and city that make up this great musical tradition. With 45 million photos being uploaded to Instagram each day, we're excited to present snapshots from Lollapalooza 2013.

## Changes introduced in this fork

This fork is specifically intended for things like display walls.

* Removed branding, changed style.
* Made configuration actually configurable - using environment variables, rather than hardcoded values.
* A full-screen button.
* Scrollbar-less, images that go off-screen are removed (with a buffer, to account for image removals)
* An 'admin mode' that lets you remove images from the stream. These removals will be broadcast to viewers and removed from their view also, as well as remembered by the daemon so that they are not broadcast to others again.
* All API requests are made from the server, rather than the clients. This reduces total API requests, and greatly simplifies image removal.
* Upgraded from Express 3.x to Express 4.x.
* Some other internal changes to fix bugs, make code more reliable or readable, etc.

## Technologies

* Node.js
* Express.js
* Socket.io
* Handlebars

## Configuration

All configuration happens through either environment variables or the [`.env file`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-node).

* `INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID`: Your ID for the Instagram API.
* `INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your secret key for the Instagram API.
* `BASE_URL`: The base URL that your application runs at. This must be publicly routable - the Instagram API will push updates to it!
* `SUBSCRIBE_TAGS`: A comma-delimited list of tags (without the `#`) to stream.
* `PORT`: The port to run on. Use [`authbind`](https://thomashunter.name/blog/using-authbind-with-node-js/) to run on privileged ports (eg. 80).
* `AUTH_KEY`: The authentication key for the 'admin mode'.
